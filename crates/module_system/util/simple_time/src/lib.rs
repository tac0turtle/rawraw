//! A very simple, no_std friendly time library for Rust that provides:
//! - a Time type that wraps an i128 representing nanoseconds since the Unix epoch
//! - a Duration type that wraps an i128 representing a number of nanoseconds
//! - const fn math operations for Time and Duration, plus basic core::ops trait implementations
//!
//! Any conversion to calendar time and parsing and formatting of date/time strings
//! should be accomplished with other libraries.
//! This library just supports very simple high precision time calculations and nothing more.
